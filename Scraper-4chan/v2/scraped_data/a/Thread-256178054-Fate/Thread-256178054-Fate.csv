"Aug-17-2023, 23:22:06","Starting with Zero is low IQ for dumb niggers who only care about battle royales. It spoils so much of FSN too. Start with deen stay night, then ufo UBW, ufo HF movies (they really suck), then ufo Zero.
Or just read the fucking VN. After that you can do whatever you want in any order you want, although it's recommended to do FHA and Zero before the others.",Anonymous,http://boards.4chan.org/a/thread/256178054/fate#p256179415

My tip is that you should watch everything in the direction it released. If there's some fucking reason a series has to move around and/or skip episodes or seasons, it's a poorly written shitty series.",Anonymous,http://boards.4chan.org/a/thread/256178054/fate#p256189280
