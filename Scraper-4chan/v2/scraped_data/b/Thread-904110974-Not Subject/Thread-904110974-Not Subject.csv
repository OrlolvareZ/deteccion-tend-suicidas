I'm actually alright with the idea as I know they'd approve it and I need my yearly checkup anyways, so I might schedule that soon. If I could get the family doctor to put on paper that I shouldn't be eating fast food, drinking water is fine, and eating less is ok maybe she'd get off my back.

but this one project keeps bouncing back but they REALLY don't want to 'add cost' (but they really need to.) we spent hours making it work so the one place that received funds from a pot that is contributed to from taxpayers can save a couple bucks.

then the other project forced a short-notice quick teams meeting so they can get me to agree to something. 
basically they sent a thing in requesting a thing and I declined. they sent it again and I declined. they sent it a third time and I almost went ""LOOK MOTHERFUCKER"" but then I calmed down and made a meme about it and sent a response saying how it still wont work.

I can't tell the difference between these two model numbers.
what is a PS? I can't tell if one has that one extra feature.

Just because something can't be used to put an addition onto the Twice cave or something doesn't mean it's not worth obtaining!
