>Red pill me on X. (with no extra content or input of your own)

>Are X white?

>Is X degeneracy?

>How come X girls love Y guys so much?

>If X is true, then how come Y? Checkmate Z.



The variety of threads allowed here are very flexible and we believe in freedom of speech, but we expect a high level of discourse befitting of the board. Attempts to disrupt the board will not be tolerated, nor will calls to disrupt other boards and sites.
