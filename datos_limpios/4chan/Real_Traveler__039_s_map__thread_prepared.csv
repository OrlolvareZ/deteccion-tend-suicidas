"May-19-2023, 02:11:50","any recommendations for a new country? the balkans perhaps? albania is the cheapest country in europe and has tons of sights. tell me more about kenya not him, but i've been to kenya too. nairobi is the worst city i've ever been to, horribly polluted and unsafe, and without a single sight worth seeing. the rest of the country is quite lovely, especially the coast. i recommend going up to lamu, comfy small seaside town. it's close to somalia and the area around it can be a bit dodgy, but lamu town itself is safe. there are loads of national parks where you can go on safaris, but each charge their own hefty entrance fee, so unless you want to sink all your money into that, research beforehand what you want to see. it's not really my thing, i only went to maasai mara for a couple of days, so i can't offer much advice. lastly, when i was there some years ago, they offered a visa that let you visit not only kenya, but several of their neighbours in east africa. i never did it (which i regret of course), but you could look into that if you want to squeeze more countries into a single trip.why did you live in bishkek?",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2458998/real-travelers-map-thread#p2460810,Real_Traveler__039_s_map__thread
"May-19-2023, 04:54:46","anon you quoted here. i definitely recommend checking out kenya and catching a safari or two. like the other anon said, there's not much to see in nairobi and some central neighbourhoods give off an unsafe vibe. we never had any actual issues though. i expected a lot of beggars in nairobi coming after us because i'm white but that also never happened. nairobi was the main spot where we stayed (airbnb is good in nairobi, we had a very pretty and spacious appartment), but we hardly did anything there except go to an elephant orphanage to watch the elephants get fed (recommended, you can pet the elephants and take pictures with them). we also did a short safari in nairobi np. we got very close to a rhino and its kid but the main thing that stuck with me was seeing all these safari animals with the nairobi skyline on the horizon.  i went with a kenyan who lives in flanders, which really enhanced the experience as they know the ins and outs of kenya. we went to visit friends and family and got to meet all kinds of interesting people, like a former mau mau insurgent. the highlight of the trip was a multi-day safari in amboseli np, which has some breathtaking sights of mt. kilimanjaro. it's a massive mountain surrounded by plains, because of which you can clearly see the mountain loom over you even from dozens of kilometers away. after that we visited a masai hut village, but you can't go without an appointment and paying them. i only went for 10 days last time which was far too short to get a good overview of the whole country, my trip this summer will be much longer. i definitely recommend taking a private driver with a safari-fit car. it's very expensive but will allow you to see much more of the country than you would with your own rental car or uber. if you have any specific questions feel free to ask.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2458998/real-travelers-map-thread#p2460871,Real_Traveler__039_s_map__thread
