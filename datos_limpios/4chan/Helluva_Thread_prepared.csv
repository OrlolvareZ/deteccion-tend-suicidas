"Jun-21-2023, 19:39:33","here's writeup #8. after about an hour or two of getting turned around, you stood near a rundown house in the middle of the suburbs thankfully the imps had quickie disguises stored away, but you feel they would've looked less out of place had they gone without them as it stands, you had walked two or three blocks with what looked like midgets in clown getups skulking around you, hiding in or behind bushes, mailboxes and trashcans. and now you stood in the middle of a slummy looking neighborhood a disembodied spirit  possessing a hellhound disguised as a scene girl on a very uncanny version of earth, surrounded by (un)trained killers from red l.a. about to kill a guy with a gag gift that the joker would call hacky. ""gee, mom, you always said i was gonna go places,"" you mumbled to yourself, grabbing and swinging loona's hair out of your eyes for what felt like the hundredth time that day. you recalled the conversation shortly before you got here ""ain't you s'posed to be back at the office mannin' the phones?"" ""uhh... well let's face it, you guys need me for this one."" ""fer what?"" "".... lookout?"" so you sat behind the bushes out front while the imps cased the place, listening and... well, smelling for trouble though despite how powerful your nose was, you probably couldn't tell what smells meant trouble and which didnt 15 minutes had gone by before you saw blitzo's clown face zipping uncomfortably close to yours, causing you to jump and let a hellhound growl bleed through your disguise all these little reflexes were starting to get old, feeling unnatural to you as if a doctor had smacked your kneecap to make your leg jump ""bad news, the guy's home right now,"" he stated plainly. ""shouldn't he be?"" you responded with a raised brow, ""whole point is to get him, isnt it?""",http://boards.4chan.org/bant/thread/17913796/helluva-thread#p17915080,Helluva_Thread

""huh? of course not, and keep it down would you? i'm just using the scope,"" moxxie responded, his gun trained on the door and windows, ""of course i might have to if we can't get him to take any bait."" ""right..."" ""unless you wanna lure him out like you did back at the beach,"" moxxie added. blitzo snapped his fingers, ""got it! loonie, why don't you go up and lure him out like you did at the beach?"" ""that's what i just said--"" ""well, loonie?"" you waited an uncomfortably long time to respond like at the beach... did they mean spring broken? no way. no goddamn way. ""aha, i uh..."" you stammered, with an awkward grin, ""i mean, i don't know, i don't uh, i don't have my makeup on, i'm not dressed for it, you know..?"" ""don't you worry about that!"" blitzo produced a makeup kit seemingly from nowhere, ""i know its costume makeup, but it should hook that creep well enough."" ""h-hey, hang on!"" he was already grabbing your face and smacking on foundation. after a couple moments, you gave up on fighting it. ... .... ....... ""ya kinda made her look like a clown,"" millie commented. ""well it is clown makeup..."" ""here, lemme see."" you sighed and let yet another pair of hands prod and touch your face. well, not your face, but still...",http://boards.4chan.org/bant/thread/17913796/helluva-thread#p17915104,Helluva_Thread

""alright, i'm heading up. be ready."" ""we're in position, loonie. seduce that fucker!"" several agonizing seconds passed before you were able to drag your feet up the driveway and to the porch even longer before you could ring the doorbell... you could do this, right? it was just acting, you could do that. right? the door opened, and you blurted your line out before the skinny gangbanger in front of you could say anything ""hey, you,"" you forced a 'seductive' grin onto loona's face, betraying the tremble in your voice, ""i was er, just wondering if you uh, liked good times..."" ""qué?"" ""uhh, like... like maybe we go out behind some bushes and make.... uhh.... fuck?"" "".... you a hooker, mang?"" ""w-what? no, i'm not--"" ""that ain't cool, mang, we got kids here. we don't need no door to door hookers."" ""whoa whoa,"" you threw your hands up, defensively, ""i'm not... do i seriously look like a hooker to you?"" ""no not really, you ain't even dressed the part. you new or somethin'?"" ""sort of, but..."" you responded, before correcting yourself, ""no! no. look, i uh... i've seen you around here a lot, and... well..."" you put your hands on your hips and leaned in, ""you seem kinda cool, man. why not step out? you know. hang out a bit?"" your eyes caught sight of a lead barrel poking through the door, and you panicked, stumbling back, feet missing the porch step there was a hard impact as you hit the concrete path, but it didn't seem to hurt as much as you figured it would... ""whoa, hey, you okay?"" the man called out, shifting demeanor like a light switch and sticking the glock back into his waistband, ""i was just tryin' to scare you, i didn't mean--whhooaa!""",http://boards.4chan.org/bant/thread/17913796/helluva-thread#p17915110,Helluva_Thread

"Jun-22-2023, 09:55:21","now i'm wondering what're the reasons behind people liking paws they're really cute, true, but why because they're nature's high heels and look elegant as fuck? (on digitigrade anthros) but then again, people like plantigrade anthros all the same or maybe i'm overthinking it and it could all be summed up in one simple word  i can tell you: the human brain craves something different, something new. the human brain's entire function is to find out what things are, what they do, and if it can hurt us or not  and it is delighted by paws. i can't understand why people would like them on plantigrade anthros, because frankly i don't like anthros, but on loona it gives her a sort of grace and beauty i find very very adorable. it's something i want to have and hold, but not possess myself.  high temperatures not bothering loona never thought of that.  exactly my point, feet are gross, paws are an elegant solution.  sleeping with loona somehow she ends up in the middle of the fucking bed every night.... you try and sleep around her she just climbs ontop of your for warmth such is the life.  loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooona",http://boards.4chan.org/bant/thread/17913796/helluva-thread#p17920136,Helluva_Thread
