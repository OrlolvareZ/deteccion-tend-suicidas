"Jun-22-2023, 09:21:16","my dream is to combine all religious pilgrimages into one 'mystical' journey, but i need to figure that out.   i know there is the via francigena from cantebury, england to rome. from there, i'd larp as a crusader to jerusalem, stopping in delphi, mt. athos, and istanbul. traditionally it goes through syria, but if by then if it still isn't safe perhaps cyprus & lebanon. then i'd larp as a muslim on hajj from jerusalem to mecca.  from mecca, is where it gets tricky.  there are several pilgrimages, but i'd prefer to keep heading east than go in circles. mt. kailash is sacred to 4 religions and has a trek, but it's in tibet. there's the char dham for hindus, in the himalayas. there are buddhist pilgrim sites further east up and within nepal there is adam's peak in sri lanka where there's a sacred footprint which could be shiva's, buddha's, adam's or st. thomas' (they haven't decided yet i guess)  i guess i could follow the hippie trail and visit goa on the way to sri lanka, go back up to nepal? and from there the hippie/banana pancake trail through southeast asia visiting various temples. i'd like to go through central china to visit the monasteries on top the jagged rocks, and head to nagasaki, japan (was place of christian martyrs who got crucified, catholic holdout in japan before getting nuked by the freemasons). then i'd like to that shikoku pilgrimage through various shinto shrines as well as to mt. fuji and i suppose end it in tokyo & later try an ayahuasca retreat in peru.   i know this sounds very schizo but i'd love to meet up with other 4chan schizos on the way. not into cooming, but if it happens it happens. if anyone has ideas to make this more organized, lmk.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2486136/itt-post-list-of-uniqueexpensive-experiences-on#p2488619,ITT_post_list_of_unique_expensive_experiences_on_your_bucket_list
