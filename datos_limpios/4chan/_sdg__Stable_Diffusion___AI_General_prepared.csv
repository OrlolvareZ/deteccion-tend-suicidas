"Jun-17-2023, 16:25:31","faq:   what's with catbox? 4chan strips metadata containing prompt info, but catbox preserves it. prompt information can be loaded from the png info tab of the webui. https://catbox.moe/ for temporary storage and slightly higher size limit: https://litterbox.catbox.moe/ 4chanx extension: https://gist.github.com/catboxanon/ca46eb79ce55e3216aecab49d5c7a3fb pro tip: look at people's uploads to see if their filename contains a catbox link. if it does, you don't have to ask for catbox, it's already there.   how do i fix bad hands? try the sd-webui-depth-lib (needs sd-webui-controlnet) and the inpainting guide in the op also try the krita plugin (auto-sd-paint-ext) for an improved inpainting/img2img workflow there are also embeddings in the negative prompt that attempt to address this. i personally don't like the approach because it can change the style too much, but some people swear by them. https://huggingface.co/zylux/orangechillmix/blob/main/badhandsv5-neg.pt   i can't make large images, i'm running out of vram cut out highres fix if you haven't already, it's very vram hungry. the ultimate upscale and multidifussion extensions upscale using tiles, allowing you to upscale images in pieces, taking only the vram necessary for the tile size you choose. the tradeoffs are tiling artifacts (it's stitching photos together), and it takes more time. https://github.com/automatic1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/troubleshooting#low-vram-video-cards",http://boards.4chan.org/e/thread/2786465/sdg-stable-diffusion-ai-general#p2786469,_sdg__Stable_Diffusion___AI_General

"Jun-17-2023, 17:20:02","alright, stupid question time: what's the correct use of | and : in tags?  would something like (medium breasts|big breasts)  or (medium breasts:big breasts) do something different? or something specific at all?",http://boards.4chan.org/e/thread/2786465/sdg-stable-diffusion-ai-general#p2786483,_sdg__Stable_Diffusion___AI_General
"Jun-17-2023, 17:33:43","the | is simply used to alternate words every other prompt. ""medium breasts|big breasts"" translates to: on even iterations ""medium breasts breasts"" on odd iterations ""medium big breasts""  i think naturally you'd want to join it with an underscore. so its ""medium_breasts|big_breasts""  the : is for substituting the prompt after a certain number of iterations, so ""[medium_breasts:big_breasts:10]"" would translate to: first 10 steps: ""medium_breasts"" step 11+: ""big_breasts"" https://github.com/automatic1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/features#alternating-words  i actually used "":"" in this image to tweak ""muscular"" so that samus appears toned but not roided out. the ""muscular"" tag has huge influence in early steps, so omitting it for the first part of the gen helps.",http://boards.4chan.org/e/thread/2786465/sdg-stable-diffusion-ai-general#p2786485,_sdg__Stable_Diffusion___AI_General
