"Jun-08-2023, 20:37:00","i went to tokyo when i was 17 in the summer of 2009. my dad was fire-chief for the city and on a couple of government boards, including one for the 9-1-1 system. and so there was a international conference going to take place and my dad was invited to go.   i was in a real dump at the time, my high school boyfriend died the year previously. so my dad thought it would be good for me to go. i always wanted to go, being a geeky weeb growing up. so i got my passport ready, dad had to pay for my seat on the 12 hour flight, but the hotel had two beds anyway. stayed at the niwa hotel near the kanda river (along with some of the other americans. not the fanciest place, but you know, taxpayer funded trip in the middle of a recession, had to cut expenses. still better than the embassy suites in dallas.   there was a japanese guy seeing to the american reps. some brought their wives or a kid along, but i didn't really hangout with them. i was like bill murray in lost in translation moping around the room, i was kinda still a little too sad my boyfriend wasn't there with me. i went with my dad to the convention one day. learned that you dialed 1-1-0 for police and 1-1-9 for for fire and ambulance, that was it. i did like their 7-11s over there. way better then how the indians run them here. the coke float with vanilla ice cream was delicious.   overall, i've done it. maybe i would rather go to a more rural place, live out ""my neighbor totoro"" fantasies. or check out the suicide forest, but i can do that here in america too, just go into any public park you'll be bound to find a few dead hobos. i just felt too much like an outsider in tokyo. i felt like i was being stared at with their beady little slanted eyes, flat faces, and high cheekbones. i'm just too much of a texan. they probably thought i had a gun on me. i don't like asian food in general, the msg causes rings on the back of my legs from sitting on the toilet too much.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2478234/why-do-i-want-to-go-back-so-badly#p2478284,No Subject
"Jan-17-2023, 02:36:50","ultimately, ending slavery is a moralfag white thing that is just a pipe dream in any isekai and the real world. we still have legal slavery here in the usa anyway, and regularly make debt slaves and criminal salves (yay prison industrial complex). ha! you thought slavery was abolished, but think again! the world runs on slavery and exploitation, be it slavery, child soldiering, or exploited workers in africa, to slaves & trafficked workers in arab nations, to suicidal chinese ""workers"" in asia (yay for concentration camps!). and guess what! none of you moralfags are ending slavery, despite it existing in your face both here and abroad. you will gladly lap up slave and sweat shop labor products day and night. even stand outside for hours for them.   think debt slavery isn't a thing here? just look at child support and the so called ""deadbeat"" dad. you fucks will defend this shit too, despite it being literal debt slavery (supposedly the thing you are ""against""), but won't let it happen to precious women of course, as if that makes it any better. criminal slaves are dead obvious: what do you think chain gangs and the people cleaning up streets are from? the only thing we got rid of was chattel/plantation slavery. we kept the rest.   so, yeah, all you will be down for slaves in isekai. just call them debt slaves or criminal slaves, and boom, you will accept it just like you accept it here in the real world. they did a ""bad"" thing, so they deserve it.",http://boards.4chan.org/e/thread/2669577/slaves#p2750693,Slaves
