"Jun-11-2023, 14:43:40","a) it's better if you use blender for weighing, but exporting a model to blender and back can fuck stuff up. if you want your deformation to not fuck shit up depending on the rotation of the torso, you will need to take the weight value of your bone from the existing weight value of its parent bone (should be 下半身 in most cases) for each vertex plus make the weights smooth. you'll probably want to avoid weighing it any other way because of pic related (pregnant morph, belly weighed to all torso bones (torso 2 is negligible though) with very smooth bdef4 weights + an invisible belly physics bone with values of up to 15%, normalized regularly [which is not what you should do], parented to an invisible movement bone, which is, in turn, parented to upper body and has a visible control bone, parented to lower body, as its local parent).  b) pmxview - object management (f2) - select ""tension movement"" from the bottom dropdown. the objects closest to the center of the handle will be affected more. boxes move the handle itself, which can also be used after you switch back to another handle type until you reset the selection (by undoing the last action or selectng an additional vertex, for example). this is useful for scaling and rotating. smoothing might be a problem tho.  keep in mind you won't get proper normals (for entirely correct shading) unless you create a separate material with your new belly shape and redo the normals for it (or save a new model with this shape and new normals), but it doesn't matter much if you aren't aiming for belly folds.",http://boards.4chan.org/e/thread/2784621/mmd-mikumikudance-184#p2785312,_mmd__MikuMikuDance__184

"Jun-15-2023, 04:12:54","the vertices you select limit the selection that could get influenced by the plugin, but the actual affected area is defined by the coordinates of the center and range. you could select the whole body, but it wouldn't all morph into a giant pregnant belly; you could select only the breasts, but the [default] range set in the parameters doesn't reach them from the central point, so nothing will happen; you can also select just a few vertices near the center point and get a skinny spike protruding from the stomach (just remember to reset the target selection in the dialog if you change it while the plugin is running), similarly to setting a small range. the size of the selection does not appear to affect computing time. as for the overhang and dangle parameters, which define the basic shape, they're up to the user's tastes. i do not recommend expansion along the y axis, and expanding along x should be very conservative, within 0.2 at most, if you aren't into grotesque shit. repeated execution with the same parameters does not stack (reposition the vertices further), unless you refresh/re-retrieve the pmx data stored by the plugin.  in other news, after i launched the plugin again to check it for you, i suddenly realized the dialog had those missing tabs. i had forgotten to put 1.0.1 back, yet i was able to launch the plugin with 1.2.0 and 2.0.0 in the plugin folder, unlike before, despite no changes in the environment that could theoretically influence it.
