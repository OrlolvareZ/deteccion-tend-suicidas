"Jun-21-2023, 19:39:33","here's writeup #8. after about an hour or two of getting turned around, you stood near a rundown house in the middle of the suburbs thankfully the imps had quickie disguises stored away, but you feel they would've looked less out of place had they gone without them as it stands, you had walked two or three blocks with what looked like midgets in clown getups skulking around you, hiding in or behind bushes, mailboxes and trashcans. and now you stood in the middle of a slummy looking neighborhood a disembodied spirit  possessing a hellhound disguised as a scene girl on a very uncanny version of earth, surrounded by (un)trained killers from red l.a. about to kill a guy with a gag gift that the joker would call hacky. ""gee, mom, you always said i was gonna go places,"" you mumbled to yourself, grabbing and swinging loona's hair out of your eyes for what felt like the hundredth time that day. you recalled the conversation shortly before you got here ""ain't you s'posed to be back at the office mannin' the phones?"" ""uhh... well let's face it, you guys need me for this one."" ""fer what?"" "".... lookout?"" so you sat behind the bushes out front while the imps cased the place, listening and... well, smelling for trouble though despite how powerful your nose was, you probably couldn't tell what smells meant trouble and which didnt 15 minutes had gone by before you saw blitzo's clown face zipping uncomfortably close to yours, causing you to jump and let a hellhound growl bleed through your disguise all these little reflexes were starting to get old, feeling unnatural to you as if a doctor had smacked your kneecap to make your leg jump ""bad news, the guy's home right now,"" he stated plainly. ""shouldn't he be?"" you responded with a raised brow, ""whole point is to get him, isnt it?""",http://boards.4chan.org/bant/thread/17913796/helluva-thread#p17915080,Helluva_Thread

""huh? of course not, and keep it down would you? i'm just using the scope,"" moxxie responded, his gun trained on the door and windows, ""of course i might have to if we can't get him to take any bait."" ""right..."" ""unless you wanna lure him out like you did back at the beach,"" moxxie added. blitzo snapped his fingers, ""got it! loonie, why don't you go up and lure him out like you did at the beach?"" ""that's what i just said--"" ""well, loonie?"" you waited an uncomfortably long time to respond like at the beach... did they mean spring broken? no way. no goddamn way. ""aha, i uh..."" you stammered, with an awkward grin, ""i mean, i don't know, i don't uh, i don't have my makeup on, i'm not dressed for it, you know..?"" ""don't you worry about that!"" blitzo produced a makeup kit seemingly from nowhere, ""i know its costume makeup, but it should hook that creep well enough."" ""h-hey, hang on!"" he was already grabbing your face and smacking on foundation. after a couple moments, you gave up on fighting it. ... .... ....... ""ya kinda made her look like a clown,"" millie commented. ""well it is clown makeup..."" ""here, lemme see."" you sighed and let yet another pair of hands prod and touch your face. well, not your face, but still...",http://boards.4chan.org/bant/thread/17913796/helluva-thread#p17915104,Helluva_Thread

""alright, i'm heading up. be ready."" ""we're in position, loonie. seduce that fucker!"" several agonizing seconds passed before you were able to drag your feet up the driveway and to the porch even longer before you could ring the doorbell... you could do this, right? it was just acting, you could do that. right? the door opened, and you blurted your line out before the skinny gangbanger in front of you could say anything ""hey, you,"" you forced a 'seductive' grin onto loona's face, betraying the tremble in your voice, ""i was er, just wondering if you uh, liked good times..."" ""qué?"" ""uhh, like... like maybe we go out behind some bushes and make.... uhh.... fuck?"" "".... you a hooker, mang?"" ""w-what? no, i'm not--"" ""that ain't cool, mang, we got kids here. we don't need no door to door hookers."" ""whoa whoa,"" you threw your hands up, defensively, ""i'm not... do i seriously look like a hooker to you?"" ""no not really, you ain't even dressed the part. you new or somethin'?"" ""sort of, but..."" you responded, before correcting yourself, ""no! no. look, i uh... i've seen you around here a lot, and... well..."" you put your hands on your hips and leaned in, ""you seem kinda cool, man. why not step out? you know. hang out a bit?"" your eyes caught sight of a lead barrel poking through the door, and you panicked, stumbling back, feet missing the porch step there was a hard impact as you hit the concrete path, but it didn't seem to hurt as much as you figured it would... ""whoa, hey, you okay?"" the man called out, shifting demeanor like a light switch and sticking the glock back into his waistband, ""i was just tryin' to scare you, i didn't mean--whhooaa!""",http://boards.4chan.org/bant/thread/17913796/helluva-thread#p17915110,Helluva_Thread

"Jun-22-2023, 09:55:21","now i'm wondering what're the reasons behind people liking paws they're really cute, true, but why because they're nature's high heels and look elegant as fuck? (on digitigrade anthros) but then again, people like plantigrade anthros all the same or maybe i'm overthinking it and it could all be summed up in one simple word  i can tell you: the human brain craves something different, something new. the human brain's entire function is to find out what things are, what they do, and if it can hurt us or not  and it is delighted by paws. i can't understand why people would like them on plantigrade anthros, because frankly i don't like anthros, but on loona it gives her a sort of grace and beauty i find very very adorable. it's something i want to have and hold, but not possess myself.  high temperatures not bothering loona never thought of that.  exactly my point, feet are gross, paws are an elegant solution.  sleeping with loona somehow she ends up in the middle of the fucking bed every night.... you try and sleep around her she just climbs ontop of your for warmth such is the life.  loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooona",http://boards.4chan.org/bant/thread/17913796/helluva-thread#p17920136,Helluva_Thread

"Jun-19-2023, 04:28:04","i had similar feelings and decided to move to japan in early 2020. i have a reasonably good job, now i'm earning around 11m yen (which is not a lot at the current exchange rate but is an okay salary for japan).  japan is fun but what i didn't realize is just how isolating this experience would be. i lived in 7 different countries before, and even those where english isn't the main language were never as bad as japan. most of the people who speak english here are weird expats or gaijin hunters; 99% of normal people will not be able to have a conversation with you beyond ""hello how are you"". it is just depressing to be here, in such a lively metropolis, and be completely alone without being able to communicate with anyone. i have been making efforts to learn japanese and it's going okay, but after 3 years my level is nowhere near being able to comfortably make close friends and enjoy all aspects of the culture. i am not sure if i'll be able to devote more time of my life to this place as i don't actually know if i will enjoy it even if i do learn the language properly, it might all be a sisyphean task for all i know.   i know people like to respond ""well duh what did you expect"" to posts like this, but it genuinely is not like this in other countries. japan is a unique mix of weird antisocial culture, people who are autistic by nature, a terrible education system that doesn't prepare you for anything, and a lack of interest in other cultures. it is just not fun, i don't know how else to express it exactly.  sorry for the blogpost. make sure you really know what you're getting into if you come here for long term. it's probably easier if you're a weeb (i'm not)",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2478234/why-do-i-want-to-go-back-so-badly#p2485943,No Subject

"Jun-17-2023, 08:21:22","i am also an autistic introvert who was the same as you.  the way i got over this was after reading a book called yes man by danny wallace (there is a famous movie, but the book is better).   (no spoilers i promise): basically, it's a memoir of an english guy who had a lonely and isolated life until a stranger on a bus told him to ""say yes more"". he autistically twisted that to start saying yes to everything, and his life completely changed.   anyway, by forcing yourself to say yes to everything, you are basically surrendering to god's will, putting your life in the hands of the universe. it's easy for people to just say ""just put yourself out there, do drugs, etc."" but what you need is to practice radical openness. you need to force yourself to say yes, even if it makes you uncomfortable. obviously, set boundaries on illegal shit, but just say yes to everything. start at home first, then you will eventually end up traveling.  this is me, the stranger on the bus, telling you and anyone reading this to ""say yes more"". just say yes. you see something on a bulletin board? just go to it. homeless guy asks for $5? give it to him, or buy him something worth $5. a peace corps recruiter is speaking at your university? go to it - that's how my friend ended up living in kyrgyzstan for 2 years.  something that happened to me: i usually get emails from my company saying there is a get-together at some restaurant. i work remotely and live 2 hours away, so i've never met these people. i said ""yes"" and actually met a lot of employees in the company. there i found out the company would give $500-$1000 bonuses to those who get a certificate (some software shit).   say yes more.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2483351/how-do-you-travel-as-an-autist#p2484551,How_do_you_travel_as_an_autist

"Jun-11-2023, 14:43:40","a) it's better if you use blender for weighing, but exporting a model to blender and back can fuck stuff up. if you want your deformation to not fuck shit up depending on the rotation of the torso, you will need to take the weight value of your bone from the existing weight value of its parent bone (should be 下半身 in most cases) for each vertex plus make the weights smooth. you'll probably want to avoid weighing it any other way because of pic related (pregnant morph, belly weighed to all torso bones (torso 2 is negligible though) with very smooth bdef4 weights + an invisible belly physics bone with values of up to 15%, normalized regularly [which is not what you should do], parented to an invisible movement bone, which is, in turn, parented to upper body and has a visible control bone, parented to lower body, as its local parent).  b) pmxview - object management (f2) - select ""tension movement"" from the bottom dropdown. the objects closest to the center of the handle will be affected more. boxes move the handle itself, which can also be used after you switch back to another handle type until you reset the selection (by undoing the last action or selectng an additional vertex, for example). this is useful for scaling and rotating. smoothing might be a problem tho.  keep in mind you won't get proper normals (for entirely correct shading) unless you create a separate material with your new belly shape and redo the normals for it (or save a new model with this shape and new normals), but it doesn't matter much if you aren't aiming for belly folds.",http://boards.4chan.org/e/thread/2784621/mmd-mikumikudance-184#p2785312,_mmd__MikuMikuDance__184

"Jun-15-2023, 04:12:54","the vertices you select limit the selection that could get influenced by the plugin, but the actual affected area is defined by the coordinates of the center and range. you could select the whole body, but it wouldn't all morph into a giant pregnant belly; you could select only the breasts, but the [default] range set in the parameters doesn't reach them from the central point, so nothing will happen; you can also select just a few vertices near the center point and get a skinny spike protruding from the stomach (just remember to reset the target selection in the dialog if you change it while the plugin is running), similarly to setting a small range. the size of the selection does not appear to affect computing time. as for the overhang and dangle parameters, which define the basic shape, they're up to the user's tastes. i do not recommend expansion along the y axis, and expanding along x should be very conservative, within 0.2 at most, if you aren't into grotesque shit. repeated execution with the same parameters does not stack (reposition the vertices further), unless you refresh/re-retrieve the pmx data stored by the plugin.  in other news, after i launched the plugin again to check it for you, i suddenly realized the dialog had those missing tabs. i had forgotten to put 1.0.1 back, yet i was able to launch the plugin with 1.2.0 and 2.0.0 in the plugin folder, unlike before, despite no changes in the environment that could theoretically influence it.
