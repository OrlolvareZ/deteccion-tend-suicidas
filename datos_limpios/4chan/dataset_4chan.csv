Do not post requests here unless you have at least 6 pictures related to what you're requesting. - Pictures featuring girls with a loli body type, or Furry pictures.

"Jun-21-2023, 19:39:33","Here's writeup #8. after about an hour or two of getting turned around, you stood near a rundown house in the middle of the suburbs thankfully the imps had quickie disguises stored away, but you feel they would've looked less out of place had they gone without them as it stands, you had walked two or three blocks with what looked like midgets in clown getups skulking around you, hiding in or behind bushes, mailboxes and trashcans. and now you stood in the middle of a slummy looking neighborhood a disembodied spirit  possessing a hellhound disguised as a scene girl on a very uncanny version of earth, surrounded by (un)trained killers from red L.A. about to kill a guy with a gag gift that the Joker would call hacky. ""Gee, mom, you always said I was gonna go places,"" you mumbled to yourself, grabbing and swinging Loona's hair out of your eyes for what felt like the hundredth time that day. you recalled the conversation shortly before you got here ""Ain't you s'posed to be back at the office mannin' the phones?"" ""Uhh... Well let's face it, you guys NEED me for this one."" ""Fer what?"" "".... Lookout?"" so you sat behind the bushes out front while the imps cased the place, listening and... well, smelling for trouble though despite how powerful your nose was, you probably couldn't tell what smells meant trouble and which didnt 15 minutes had gone by before you saw Blitzo's clown face zipping uncomfortably close to yours, causing you to jump and let a hellhound growl bleed through your disguise all these little reflexes were starting to get old, feeling unnatural to you as if a doctor had smacked your kneecap to make your leg jump ""Bad news, the guy's home right now,"" he stated plainly. ""Shouldn't he be?"" you responded with a raised brow, ""Whole point is to get him, isnt it?""",http://boards.4chan.org/bant/thread/17913796/helluva-thread#p17915080,Helluva_Thread
"Jun-21-2023, 19:43:04","""Well, we were gonna break in and throw some traps up—toaster glued to the bathtub ceiling, rig the outlets to light the whole place on fire, that sorta thing..."" he stepped away, scratching his chin, ""We gotta wait for the guy to leave now, and judging from his house I doubt the guy's even seen the sun in a while, so... unless..."" You looked to your right, freezing up again as you saw Moxxie poking his rifle straight through the shrub ""Jeeze, I thought you weren't gonna shoot him?!"" ""Huh? Of course not, and keep it down would you? I'm just using the scope,"" Moxxie responded, his gun trained on the door and windows, ""Of course I might have to if we can't get him to take any bait."" ""Right..."" ""Unless you wanna lure him out like you did back at the beach,"" Moxxie added. Blitzo snapped his fingers, ""Got it! Loonie, why don't you go up and lure him out like you did at the beach?"" ""That's what I just said--"" ""Well, Loonie?"" you waited an uncomfortably long time to respond like at the beach... did they mean Spring Broken? no way. no goddamn way. ""Aha, I uh..."" You stammered, with an awkward grin, ""I mean, I don't know, I don't uh, I don't have my makeup on, I'm not DRESSED for it, you know..?"" ""Don't you worry about that!"" Blitzo produced a makeup kit seemingly from nowhere, ""I know its costume makeup, but it should hook that creep well enough."" ""H-hey, hang on!"" He was already grabbing your face and smacking on foundation. After a couple moments, you gave up on fighting it. ... .... ....... ""Ya kinda made her look like a clown,"" Millie commented. ""Well it IS clown makeup..."" ""Here, lemme see."" you sighed and let yet another pair of hands prod and touch your face. well, not YOUR face, but still...",http://boards.4chan.org/bant/thread/17913796/helluva-thread#p17915104,Helluva_Thread
"Jun-21-2023, 19:44:53","by the time you saw Loona's face in the mirror, it looked a LOT closer to the Loona you knew, rather than the more disheveled look you've been sporting all day  Millie really knew her makeup after all shame you were about to sweat it all off though oh right, you don't sweat anymore... ""Alright, I'm heading up. Be ready."" ""We're in position, Loonie. Seduce that fucker!"" several agonizing seconds passed before you were able to drag your feet up the driveway and to the porch even longer before you could ring the doorbell... you could do this, right? It was just acting, you could do that. Right? the door opened, and you blurted your line out before the skinny gangbanger in front of you could say anything ""Hey, you,"" you forced a 'seductive' grin onto Loona's face, betraying the tremble in your voice, ""I was er, just wondering if you uh, liked good times..."" ""Qué?"" ""Uhh, like... like maybe we go out behind some bushes and make.... uhh.... fuck?"" "".... You a hooker, mang?"" ""W-what? No, I'm not--"" ""That ain't cool, mang, we got kids here. We don't need no door to door hookers."" ""Whoa whoa,"" you threw your hands up, defensively, ""I'm not... do I seriously look like a hooker to you?"" ""No not really, you ain't even dressed the part. You new or somethin'?"" ""Sort of, but..."" you responded, before correcting yourself, ""No! No. Look, I uh... I've seen you around here a lot, and... Well..."" you put your hands on your hips and leaned in, ""You seem kinda cool, man. Why not step out? You know. Hang out a bit?"" your eyes caught sight of a lead barrel poking through the door, and you panicked, stumbling back, feet missing the porch step there was a hard impact as you hit the concrete path, but it didn't seem to hurt as much as you figured it would... ""Whoa, hey, you okay?"" The man called out, shifting demeanor like a light switch and sticking the glock back into his waistband, ""I was just tryin' to scare you, I didn't mean--whhOOAA!""",http://boards.4chan.org/bant/thread/17913796/helluva-thread#p17915110,Helluva_Thread

Not long after, a portal to the IMP office opens, and all six imps hurriedly rush through it As they simmer down and collect their bearings, younger Moxxie and Millie both approach their older counterparts Younger Millie approaches her older self and starts examining her more defined abs and arm muscles whilst looking at her own, which aren't as defined Older Millie just giggles at her younger self and pats her on the head They're soon interrupted by the sound of increasingly loud chatter between two nearly identical voices ""Seriously, there's no way YOU are me 20 years in the future! I know for a fact I'll still have my guns proudly on display!"" ""Not when you become a fucking FATHER, you won't!"" ""That shouldn't change anything, though!"" ""Oh, but it does!

I'm not the one that gave up his passions just to raise some kid!"" Older Moxxie, overcome with paternal rage, decks his younger self square in the face, which causes younger Moxxie to stumble into the reception desk and fall to the floor Both Millies immediately rush to their respective husbands ""MOXXIE."" Older Millie says as she grasps onto older Moxxie's wrists softly.

Older Millie stops when she realizes that older Moxxie's fainted Loona and Blitzo exchange awkward glances at each other before looking back at what just unfolded Younger Moxxie now has a bag of ice at the location he was punched He tries forming a sense of what just happened, but all that he can manifest in his thoughts is just a grey void of nothingness ""S-So... Um. Job well done?"" Blitzo chimes in, trying to lighten the mood ""Why... why are you guys even here?"" younger Moxxie asks ""That's the thing,"" older Millie responds. ""Ah don't know.

I think present Moxxie'll grow to be more measured once he reaches the same age as this version of him since he can see firsthand how extreme he got.

"Jun-22-2023, 09:55:21","now I'm wondering what're the reasons behind people liking paws they're really cute, true, but why because they're nature's high heels and look elegant as fuck? (on digitigrade anthros) but then again, people like plantigrade anthros all the same or maybe I'm overthinking it and it could all be summed up in one simple word  I can tell you: The human brain craves something different, something new. The human brain's entire function is to find out what things are, what they do, and if it can hurt us or not  And it is delighted by paws. I can't understand why people would like them on plantigrade anthros, because frankly I don't like anthros, but on Loona it gives her a sort of grace and beauty I find very very adorable. It's something I want to have and hold, but not possess myself.  High temperatures not bothering loona Never thought of that.  exactly my point, feet are gross, paws are an elegant solution.  Sleeping with Loona Somehow she ends up in the middle of the fucking bed Every night.... You try and sleep around her She just climbs ontop of your for warmth such is the life.

Blitzo screeched, before pulling you from the corpse you were practically catatonic, your body seizing up in shock there was a vague memory of falling through a portal, but once your senses had returned, you realized you'd been placed down in Blitzo's office Blitzo was obsessively checking every part of you from head to toe, praying that nothing was broken, or cut, or scraped... ""Oh FUCK,"" he screeched again, ""your leg's all bloody, just hang on, I got bandages somewhere!"" ""It's not mine...""

Blitzo winced, his words coming out slowly and carefully now, ""No, you're not just 'out of it'. You're not... 'you'. You're a nervous wreck, you act like an intern, and... you know I haven't seen you take your break at all today?"" ""I haven't...?"" ""No, not once, you've been glued to your desk until we had to kill that guy, then you insisted on being in on it and then..."" Blitzo sighed, ""You remember a couple years back?

""I threw a stapler at him if that makes it any better."" Vortex snorted, ""I'm not broken up over it. I'd be worried about your dad, though."" ""How do you figure?""

"May-16-2023, 13:55:03","Instructions on how to use the map, courtesy of Dutch Anon.  How do you fill in the map? It's very easy. You only need to use two buttons, which I have circled in red. Say you want to colour a specific region light red, you click the tool that I marked B, and you'll see your cursor takes the shape of that tool. Then you left click the colour you want to use, i.e. the big circle. You'll notice that colour 1, which I marked C, changes to light red. If you repeat this process but you RIGHT click a coloured circle instead of left clicking it, you will select the colour as colour 2. Let's click dark red. This way you can have both shades of red selected at the same time, which makes colouring in the map more convenient, especially when doing big countries. Now you select the tool which I marked A. Let's get to colouring. Say you want to colour Indiana in light red and you want to colour Ohio in dark red. Easy.

"May-19-2023, 02:11:50","Any recommendations for a new country? The Balkans perhaps? Albania is the cheapest country in Europe and has tons of sights. Tell me more about Kenya Not him, but I've been to Kenya too. Nairobi is the worst city I've ever been to, horribly polluted and unsafe, and without a single sight worth seeing. The rest of the country is quite lovely, especially the coast. I recommend going up to Lamu, comfy small seaside town. It's close to Somalia and the area around it can be a bit dodgy, but Lamu Town itself is safe. There are loads of national parks where you can go on safaris, but each charge their own hefty entrance fee, so unless you want to sink all your money into that, research beforehand what you want to see. It's not really my thing, I only went to Maasai Mara for a couple of days, so I can't offer much advice. Lastly, when I was there some years ago, they offered a visa that let you visit not only Kenya, but several of their neighbours in East Africa. I never did it (which I regret of course), but you could look into that if you want to squeeze more countries into a single trip.Why did you live in Bishkek?",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2458998/real-travelers-map-thread#p2460810,Real_Traveler__039_s_map__thread
"May-19-2023, 04:54:46","Anon you quoted here. I definitely recommend checking out Kenya and catching a safari or two. Like the other anon said, there's not much to see in Nairobi and some central neighbourhoods give off an unsafe vibe. we never had any actual issues though. I expected a lot of beggars in Nairobi coming after us because I'm white but that also never happened. Nairobi was the main spot where we stayed (airbnb is good in Nairobi, we had a very pretty and spacious appartment), but we hardly did anything there except go to an elephant orphanage to watch the elephants get fed (recommended, you can pet the elephants and take pictures with them). We also did a short safari in Nairobi NP. We got very close to a rhino and its kid but the main thing that stuck with me was seeing all these safari animals with the Nairobi skyline on the horizon.  I went with a Kenyan who lives in Flanders, which really enhanced the experience as they know the ins and outs of Kenya. We went to visit friends and family and got to meet all kinds of interesting people, like a former Mau Mau insurgent. The highlight of the trip was a multi-day safari in Amboseli NP, which has some breathtaking sights of Mt. Kilimanjaro. It's a massive mountain surrounded by plains, because of which you can clearly see the mountain loom over you even from dozens of kilometers away. After that we visited a Masai hut village, but you can't go without an appointment and paying them. I only went for 10 days last time which was far too short to get a good overview of the whole country, my trip this summer will be much longer. I definitely recommend taking a private driver with a safari-fit car. It's very expensive but will allow you to see much more of the country than you would with your own rental car or Uber.

"May-25-2023, 13:17:10","Travelling within your own country is typically more expensive than regular life, whereas trips overseas can often be cheaper so we forgo local travel in favour of international less often than we want. Now that more budget airlines have come to Canada, me and the wife take so many more little trips around with the deals. Next weekend we are taking a 4 day trip in Halifax (We live in Vancouver) just because flights are cheap, later this year we are also going to Montreal. Last year we used budget airlines to do Ottawa, Winnipeg, Calgary, New York trips. All were just long weekend trips to see the top 5 list in each kinda thing.   All that to say, if you feel personally undertraveled...just use Ryan air to visit every major city in Europe for weekend trips. Don't worry about TRV approved locations, just go nuts. You are lucky to have such easy access, use it without being picky. Flights for you are probably $15 Euro or whatever bs.

We both have professional-ish jobs (I am an engineer, she is a research scientist), so we are blessed in that we make decent enough money (we don't make dickbag financebro money, our household income is something like $140k leafbux/yr) that's more than we need by a long shot. We put a lot of work into saving and planning.  1. The train I want to take goes through it 2. Turbo Autism and my rockcock obsession with pre-pottery neolithic shit.  3. Cheap 4. Roman shit.  5. Food In that order.  Our route is guided by our desire to take the train from Portugal to Singapore (best we can) so any suggestions that we detour to Zambia go right into the trash. 1. Exploring all of Europe is literally not the point of the trip. Like going to the grocery store to buy ingredients for pancakes and some dude spergs on you in the checkout line why he thinks breakfast is stupid and you should be buying salmon and artichokes.  2. I would rather travel for 2 months than 3 weeks for the same price. Last trip we spent 3 weeks in the Galapagos and 3 months in India for the same reason.  3. I live somewhere without mudhuts and sand tarps... so I would like to see those. That's literally the whole point of travelling, see different things.  fingers crossed it works that way",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2458998/real-travelers-map-thread#p2469190,Real_Traveler__039_s_map__thread

My thoughts were around avoiding having to backtrack to Almaty to continue to Urumqi, but if they are that much more common, maybe its worth it.   Regarding Uzbekistan, people keep recommending I go that way, but the train situation seems so much more complicated, and significantly more difficult if we go from Baku  Turkmenbashi first. Otherwise we have to go KazakhstanUzbekistanKazakhstan and I don't know if standard tourist visas will let us do multiple entry or if we need to get multiple visas.

"May-29-2023, 15:38:46","You don't need a visa for either Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan, assuming you're a Canuck. Doing KZ-UZ-KZ wouldn't be a problem, did that many times. You can go from Atyrau to Uzbekistan via Beyneu and Nukus, I think there are daily trains between the two places. From Nukus you can go down through Khiva, Bukhara and Samarkand to Tashkent, from where you can go back to Shymkent/Turkestan. You can do stopovers at any of the cities, there are multiple trains linking them every day.  Having done both the Kazakh and Uzbek route multiple times, I'd fully recommend the Uzbek route for a first time visitor unless you really like spending more than 48 hours in a train through the desert/steppe.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2458998/real-travelers-map-thread#p2469211,Real_Traveler__039_s_map__thread

She could be playing a long con but at some point I need to take the risk of bringing her here to stay if I want to turn this relationship into something real and lasting.

Of course that's easy for me to say now whilst I'm still in the honeymoon period, but the current plan is that once we're ready we'll have a trial run of living together on a temporary visitor or work visa before we seriously consider marriage and/or permanent residency. The plan is we'd be living together 3-6 months (6 months is the limit for a UK visitor visa) and treating it not as a holiday but as normal life, staying at home most of the time and seeing how we get on in that situation. If we have a bad time then we'll be able to break up before we've made any major commitment like marriage or children, but if we feel that we're still a good fit then we can look into what the next step might be.  To be honest I haven't thought that far ahead in much detail though, as we've only been together for around a year and a half so far. It's difficult to know what the right balance is. I want to enjoy the time we're having right now and not get bogged down in the details yet, but at the same time you are completely right that we should be prepared for the problems that inevitably come from a long-distance relationship.

Is it difficult to travel between Kunduz and the Wakhan corridor? What was the worst/best experience?  The Taliban have detained 7 foreigners this year so far. 6 Europeans and 1 American. All fair-skinned who probably don't know the local languages, and I'd say at least 3 of them were lacking in travel experience.  I'd estimate 20-30 tourists visit the country per day. 1.5-2% of this year's tourists were detained if that estimate is accurate. Taliban hostage diplomacy seems to be booming.  Is it possible that they promote foreign tourism as a trap to use foreigners as bargaining chips later?",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2458998/real-travelers-map-thread#p2482975,Real_Traveler__039_s_map__thread
"Jun-15-2023, 09:13:20","I traveled with a guide initially, and then went alone as my Dari got better. I had prepared bt studying Persian for half a year before going. After a few weeks I got the hang of it enough to have basic conversations and most importantly explain who I was to the taliban and respond to their questions. If you don't speak any local languages, I wouldn't recommend traveling without a guide. The likelihood that you get arrested is way higher if you can't explain who you are and what you're doing. Google translate doesn't really work that well because most people are illiterate.  I got my permits from Kabul and then went to the ministry of culture to get them signed. You need a letter of invitation from a registered tour agency and an Afghan who will take responsibility for you. If anything happens to you, he will get blamed. Some people travel without permits but I can't recommend it. I generally passed through checkpoints quickly when I had documents with official signatures vouching for me.  Easy to travel between Kunduz and Badakhshan. Shared taxis to Faizabad are like 700afg. After Ishkashim transport starts to get expensive. I don't know exactly how much since I rode my motorcycle. The only thing is the authorities in Badakhshan are strict about permits and will send you back to Kabul if you don't have them.   Best experience was being hosted by local people in their homes. People are extraordinarily friendly. However there are a lot of scammers and thieves you have to watch out for. Worst experience was getting detained by the taliban army for a night for no reason.   Of course I thought about the hostage thing before I went. I decided it was worth it because I had dreamed of visiting for so long. I looked at all of the cases and it seemed like each person who got arrested had done something stupid. Visiting the gun market in Jalalabad for example. Traveling with a guide will lower your chances. People were way more suspicious of me when I was alone.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2458998/real-travelers-map-thread#p2483131,Real_Traveler__039_s_map__thread

"Jun-17-2023, 08:46:54","Thanks for sharing I'm still thinking whether I should go or not. The plan is to go in late October / November. I would enter at Torkham (Pakistan) and go straight to Kabul to obtain permits, then head to Bamyan and hitchhike along Hindu Kush west to Herat. Then south to Kandahar and finally north to Kabul (again) - Mazar-i-Sharif - Kunduz - Tajikistan.  From what I've read, having permits vastly reduces the chance of being detained. In cities I plan to hire a guide. And I'd buy the Taliban flag, just as a potential ""get out of jail free card"".. apparently the taliban love taking pics with it.

"Jun-17-2023, 10:31:51","Yeah I wore local clothes the whole time. I wouldn't recommend wearing western clothes. It's such a genetically diverse country almost anyone can sort of blend in if you're wearing afghan clothes.  I've hitchhiked in 8 countries but I didn't try it in Afghanistan. If you're considering hitchhiking in Afghanistan I assume you're a veteran hitchhiker, so you might not need to hear this, but in this region there isn't a hitchhiking culture like in the west. People will stand on the side of the road and flag down cars, but they're expected to pay. Usually you'll end up in a shared taxi. If you want to go to free you'll have to explain it to the driver, which can get awkward.  So try it, but be prepared to pay like you would for a taxi. Going with truckers would a good option but I don't know how many trucks are going from Bamiyan to Herat. Anyways, I'll be interested to hear about your trip. Learn farsi.  About your flag idea, what I'd say is acting pro taliban will not guarantee your safety. In fact there was just an Austrian guy arrested this month.

"Jun-08-2023, 20:37:00","I went to Tokyo when I was 17 in the summer of 2009. My dad was fire-chief for the city and on a couple of government boards, including one for the 9-1-1 system. And so there was a international conference going to take place and my dad was invited to go.   I was in a real dump at the time, my high school boyfriend died the year previously. So my dad thought it would be good for me to go. I always wanted to go, being a geeky weeb growing up. So I got my passport ready, dad had to pay for my seat on the 12 hour flight, but the hotel had two beds anyway. Stayed at the Niwa Hotel near the Kanda river (along with some of the other Americans. Not the fanciest place, but you know, taxpayer funded trip in the middle of a recession, had to cut expenses. Still better than the Embassy Suites in Dallas.   There was a Japanese guy seeing to the American reps. Some brought their wives or a kid along, but I didn't really hangout with them. I was like Bill Murray in Lost in Translation moping around the room, I was kinda still a little too sad my boyfriend wasn't there with me. I went with my dad to the convention one day. Learned that you dialed 1-1-0 for police and 1-1-9 for for fire and ambulance, that was it. I did like their 7-11s over there. Way better then how the indians run them here. The coke float with vanilla ice cream was delicious.   Overall, I've done it. Maybe I would rather go to a more rural place, live out ""My Neighbor Totoro"" fantasies. Or check out the suicide forest, But I can do that here in America too, just go into any public park you'll be bound to find a few dead hobos. I just felt too much like an outsider in Tokyo. I felt like I was being stared at with their beady little slanted eyes, flat faces, and high cheekbones. I'm just too much of a Texan. They probably thought I had a gun on me. I don't like Asian food in general, the MSG causes rings on the back of my legs from sitting on the toilet too much.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2478234/why-do-i-want-to-go-back-so-badly#p2478284,No Subject

I've lived all over the world and Japan stands out to me for three reasons: the women, the society (parts) and the scenery. The scenery can be very breathtaking but is disheveled by the humidity in the summer making it difficult to truly enough being in nature; the women are not sexy to me and my western sensibility that values waist to hip ratio over cuteness, but cuteness has a certain appeal and the Japanese do it best simple as; it is extremely quiet over here, very peaceful and consequently an ideal environment for studying as western propaganda and talking points are generally absent from discourse and every day life which is extremely cathartic.   Unless I am missing something, the Japanese aren't really a fun people. People from Osaka and to a lesser extent Tokyo are fun but the overwhelming majority of Japanese youth are too involved in job hunting and shit to have fun.

"Jun-19-2023, 04:28:04","I had similar feelings and decided to move to Japan in early 2020. I have a reasonably good job, now I'm earning around 11M yen (which is not a lot at the current exchange rate but is an okay salary for Japan).  Japan is fun but what I didn't realize is just how isolating this experience would be. I lived in 7 different countries before, and even those where English isn't the main language were never as bad as Japan. Most of the people who speak English here are weird expats or gaijin hunters; 99% of normal people will not be able to have a conversation with you beyond ""hello how are you"". It is just depressing to be here, in such a lively metropolis, and be completely alone without being able to communicate with anyone. I have been making efforts to learn Japanese and it's going okay, but after 3 years my level is nowhere near being able to comfortably make close friends and enjoy all aspects of the culture. I am not sure if I'll be able to devote more time of my life to this place as I don't actually know if I will enjoy it even if I do learn the language properly, it might all be a sisyphean task for all I know.   I know people like to respond ""well duh what did you expect"" to posts like this, but it genuinely is NOT like this in other countries. Japan is a unique mix of weird antisocial culture, people who are autistic by nature, a terrible education system that doesn't prepare you for anything, and a lack of interest in other cultures. It is just not fun, I don't know how else to express it exactly.  Sorry for the blogpost. Make sure you really know what you're getting into if you come here for long term. It's probably easier if you're a weeb (I'm not)",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2478234/why-do-i-want-to-go-back-so-badly#p2485943,No Subject

Japan is a unique mix of weird antisocial culture, people who are autistic by nature, a terrible education system that doesn't prepare you for anything, and a lack of interest in other cultures. It is just not fun, I don't know how else to express it exactly. I've been testing out Japan (tokyo) for 1 month to get a sense of the life here. I don't think you'd be wrong to come to the conclusion that the average Japanese person just lives a very...mundane and uninspiring life.  I think I will be striking it off my short list of countries to expat too If it were super worth it, I'd not hesistate to revive my Japanese studies and grind hard at it for 2 years, but I don't think it would really unlock   If you haven't made many roots or gotten a proper Japanese gf in 3 years, I'd really be thinking hard about the question you brought up: whether Japan is worth more investment of your limited time on Earth. Even if you do crack it, your monolingual japanese friends/girl will be non-functional outside of japan. they won't be adventuring without being dependent on you for everything  For me, my short list will now be Sichuan, china/northern thailand/bangkok/and maybe even Kuala Lumpur (malaysian chinese girls are fire). I will conclude by saying that I do wish that there was a ""Japan for white people"" somewhere in the world   I'll keep Japan on my radar for if I ever need a low cost life reset, restoring an Akiya house in the countryside, but I'm only 30 years old and wouldn't be in such a position for at bare minimum 5 years",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2478234/why-do-i-want-to-go-back-so-badly#p2486125,No Subject

The thing that most sticks out to me is their notion that the soul is connected to the ancestral homeland, and as a result when you die your spirit inhabits a place in between the real world and the heavens. It is why Zulu people are so superstitious about ancestor spirits. It makes sense to me on an intuitive level to tell you the truth. I mean if I died I would prefer to spend some time watching over my family and people before fucking off to paradise.

"Jun-20-2023, 05:46:47","violent crime reporting statistics Africa Oh so you're retarded. Shit is so commonplace it isn't reported or is under reported. Yet another dumbfuck niggerlover reporting one of the oldest and most idiotic niggerlove meme on the planet.  The way to see how safe a place actually is, is simple. When you arrive you look and see what measures locals take to deter violent home invasion robbery.  Everywhere in Africa the standard for middling wealth and above is walls and electrified barbed wire and spikes on the walls and armed security if they can afford it.  If it was safer than the usa it wouldn't be the standard. There is no effective police response to anything. There is no physical security in public unless you are at a venue, and definitely not after dark.  You can be safe if you stay in a resort your whole trip. The second you start to live among Africans you must adopt a richfag security posture, because to them you are a richfag.  Africans stand around doing nothing all day. They just loiter. They see you come and go. If you have a routine they will notice it. Somebody will be informed when you are out and your shit will get broken into and everything down to your pube trimmer will be stolen.  The only safety to be had is behind walls, heavy gates, barred gated doors. Even Africans who live in apartments have double doors, with a prison bar apparatus with heavy locks in front. They also have these bars on their windows. You see the same things in ghettos in the usa, because there is something in common there: lots of niggers with nothing to lose and infinite time.  Oh but (nationality) are nice!  That's great dipshit. How about the millions of displaced Sudanese, Somalians, Nigerians, central Africa literal cannibal child soldiers and etc? There is no border security in Africa. Psychos just roam around.  You, the muzungo, are an easy payday.

In South Africa dare devil travelers attempt to drive from Cape Town to Cairo in Toyota 4x4s. You should read their accounts, they are very interesting. The one thing that is most common is that border guards do not give a shit about paperwork or passports.

"Jun-20-2023, 06:00:24","Normies instantly sense this when they visit, which is why they stay in their hotels and resorts unless going on a guided tour.  This is not fucking Thailand where you can just wander around drunk all day and rest assured you will make it home in one piece.  Do African women love white men, and is having irresponsible cum in pussy sex with fertile jungle bunnies easy? Yes.  However do not go in with a babe in the woods mentality. Do not think for a second that the ""violent crime statistics"" are accurate. Murder, motorcycle mugging, robbery, fighting/beatings are common, practically an accepted facet of life. People don't get murdered in Africa they just disappear and their body never gets found because wild dogs and other wildlife eat it within a few days.   The vast majority of murder in Africa goes unsolved and uninvestigated and most of the time unreported. The only time police do investigation work is when they have public scrutiny or are being paid to do so.  Speaking of police, they will rob from you too. Demanding bribes is commonplace. If you try to transport yourself you will be pulled over and forced to give them bribes. This can happen several times a month. If you refuse they will arrest you and impound your vehicle.  Remember, everyone in the country has infinite time and nothing to lose, so they take the path of least resistance to the best and easiest payout possible.  Africans do not have a sense of future consequences. They act illogically and in self destructive ways. They simply don't care. There is no reasoning with them because they cannot and do not use reason to arrive at conclusion.  Africans are never on time. Time does not exist to them. There is no past or future, only the present. Being late to something is not their fault. It's the fault of the nigger who they were in the past. They aren't the same person.

"Jun-20-2023, 06:22:12","By the way infinite time nothing to lose Applies to the women too. It won't just be men fucking with you. In fact most of your problems will come from the women if you are a coomer. Even if you are a ""gentleman coomer"", it won't matter due to ITNTL Africans targeting you since you are the only potential source or whitebux in their life maybe.  African women no matter their nationality or situation are very territorial. Even hookers get jealous because they know some other paid pussy is getting your whitebux, and not them. From a cost/benefit perspective they have nothing to lose by fighting another hoe and ripping her weave out, so you go with her instead.   They have nothing to lose by stalking you. Nothing to lose by knocking on your door randomly during the week to beg for dick and money. Nothing to lose by attacking other women you bring home. Zero consequences, again because police don't deal with this shit unless you beat them yourself, which is what they want because it means a big payout is coming soon.  You cannot defend yourself from African women, because the police side with them in all cases.   Coom and go. Don't stick around. If you stay long enough for a woman to get territorial then expect drama. They have NOTHING BETTER TO DO, so drama will come.   Yes you can have sex. Yes you Will have sex. Yes, you will also experience African retardation first hand to a minor or greater degree.  They aren't human. They are animals.

"Jun-20-2023, 06:39:13","Lastly, lest you be under some delusion.  All African women are whores. Having an African girlfriend means supporting her financially. You are perceived to be several dozen times wealthier than her, and rightly so in 99.99% of cases. Thus you will be expected to pay for her everything up to her actual rent. It doesn't matter how much you actually do spend on her, it will never be enough.  You can take a dirt poor no job African cutie and she will spend infinite amounts of your money to be a ""queen"". They believe all muzungu are infinitely rich. Never expect them to behave themselves or be sensible. Getting a muzungu sugar daddy is basically a winning a lottery situation so they will max it out.  As I said it doesn't matter how much you give her. She ""knows"" you could give more, will never respect or acknowledge your support. She is your queen so she deserves it, that is the situation.  Many an elderly muzungu has been fleeced in this manner by a young African lady.  Remember: infinite time nothing to lose. This mantra affects all interactions you will ever have with Africans. Whenever an African begins wasting your time or annoying you, just remember, it doesn't matter to them it only matters to you.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2481228/african-general-nomad-edition#p2486887,African__General___NOMAD_edition
"Jun-20-2023, 06:50:24","Oh well let me address this too.  African spirituality. Lol.  They literally believe in magic and witchcraft. In the absence of a functioning security apparatus they just go all in on what is basically prayer and ritual.   Witchdoctor is an actual profession and every town and city has dozens to hundreds of practictioners who provide a paid service in casting spells on people or locations for various effects.  Magic is as real to Africans as it is in the Harry Potter world. They live in a constant fantastical delusion. Don't disparage their beliefs unless you want to piss people off. It is very real and important to them.  Sure you can ask chicks about it but control your reaction. They believe some really stupid shit that is straight up embarrassing to hear about it, and they will let it all out with no shame.  The truly funny part is they will go to Christian church also, and it's a very big community deal. They don't believe their witchcraft spirit is bullshit is incompatible with another religion, rather its supplemental or downright unrelated.  Skill at witchdoctoring is not a religious skill, it's a practical skill such as being an actual doctor or medical tech.  It's definitely an experience. My posts may seem disparaging, but they are meant to be a WARNING. Heed the warning and you can have a great time.  Act like you are in Asia or Europe and you will get blown the fuck out so fast your head will spin.   Actual last bit: objective truth does not exist in Africa. There is no such thing as a lie to an African. They lie glibly and shamelessly, and don't care if they are caught lying. They simply tell you what they think will get them whitebux. It is useless and a waste of time to get them to feel bad about being dishonest or asking them why they lied.   They are born without shame and die without shame. Christians think they can teach African shame and humility through their religion, but it didn't work.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2481228/african-general-nomad-edition#p2486900,African__General___NOMAD_edition

Sex is a primary recreation activity in Africa because they are poor and nothing to do, so they become quite skilled at it very young. There are no shy virgin 18 year olds in Africa.

The lagoon is ok, but horribly crowded. Megalithic sites are great if you know what to expect (big fucking stones) and are in it just for the age. They're in the middle of nowhere, but that's fine if you have a car. Speaking of cars, Malta's traffic is obnoxious for a tiny island. Narrow streets that get clogged up in massive traffic jams. The bus network is the most dysfunctional piece of shit I've ever seen, but you'd be mercifully skipping on that with a rental. Driving on the left is awkward at the start, gets easier later but never really becomes truly intuitive. You're not likely to fuck up and crash into someone though. As the other guy said, your biggest issue will be turning on the wipers all the time. Kinnie's delicious.

I was like you in the city, and I met the goddes by asking her which train should I hop on to get to a museum. She told me I am dumb because its monday and all the museums are closed, but she is heading to the beach and I can go with her if I want.  What I want to say are two things: A - for guys like us we need to get out of the comfort zone and try. Just before I asked her on the street I got nervos, and I almost decided to fuck it and get back to the hotel. But I gathered courage, I was sweating and still did it. B: you said that you visited only churches? Why? You need to go towards the adventure.

On the bus every nepali was asking me where am I going, we had a great talk. We got into a traffic jam next to a village, I had no more water so I went to buy from the ordinary guys, they invited me to their huts and gave me like a 100 year old coca cola. The traffic jam got seriously big and I was in the village for 6 hours. The night came and the whole village wanted to check out the white guy, everybody wanted to have a talk with me. Then the police came, the jam was caused by a truck which has fallen into a mud, and they need people to pull it out because they are tired. I volunteered and I helped to pull out a truck in a middle of a nowhere at night. In nepal. Me, a fucking antisocial loser.

"Jun-16-2023, 14:53:20","(REPLY) Besides the drugs/alcohol suggestions to help stop thinking, consider doing some self introspection, you should come to the conclusion that yes you do want to interact with people and yes you do want interesting stories. Then when you feel that hesitation to approach and strike up a conversation, you can just remember that you already came to the conclusion that this is what you want to do, it's not something to decide anymore, it's a foregone conclusion and it's inevitable. If you're still having trouble, really remember that this is your one life, your one opportunity, you don't want to look back and regret like you're doing now, or worse have it end without experiencing some simple joys. You already know how it feels to not go out and talk to people and try new things, it feels bad, so save yourself the pain and talk to them. Worst case they're complete assholes or it's just very awkward, but then you can just move on and at least you tried, and you'll find other people to interact with.if an antisocial sperg starts drinking/taking drugs he won't magically become an extroverted Chad doing various stuff left and right, he will more than likely just become a solitary alcoholic/junkie shooting up or drinking in his own room alone eh it's possible, but he's not so antisocial that he's not leaving the house, he just needs a final push once he's there to get things going. I was an antisocial sperg but after going somewhere and drinking a bit I stopped caring about being self conscious and I was able to chat up and have a lot of fun with dozens of complete strangers for the rest of the night. I was still a bit awkward and definitely not a chad but it made for a way more fun experience than if I had just stayed in my room for the night.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2483351/how-do-you-travel-as-an-autist#p2484073,How_do_you_travel_as_an_autist

You'll get some people who don't like you but it's okay. For interacting with strangers, taking care of your appearance does make a difference. Don't be smelly, wear normal clothes, have neat hair and facial hair, etc.  Walking around and exploring cities alone can be kino. I enjoy it at least.

"Jun-17-2023, 08:21:22","I am also an autistic introvert who was the same as you.  The way I got over this was after reading a book called Yes Man by Danny Wallace (there is a famous movie, but the book is better).   (no spoilers I promise): Basically, it's a memoir of an English guy who had a lonely and isolated life until a stranger on a bus told him to ""say yes more"". He autistically twisted that to start saying yes to everything, and his life completely changed.   Anyway, by forcing yourself to say yes to everything, you are basically surrendering to God's will, putting your life in the hands of the universe. It's easy for people to just say ""just put yourself out there, do drugs, etc."" but what you need is to practice radical openness. You need to force yourself to say yes, even if it makes you uncomfortable. Obviously, set boundaries on illegal shit, but just say yes to everything. Start at home first, then you will eventually end up traveling.  This is me, the stranger on the bus, telling you and anyone reading this to ""Say Yes More"". Just say yes. You see something on a bulletin board? Just go to it. Homeless guy asks for $5? Give it to him, or buy him something worth $5. A Peace Corps recruiter is speaking at your university? Go to it - that's how my friend ended up living in Kyrgyzstan for 2 years.  Something that happened to me: I usually get emails from my company saying there is a get-together at some restaurant. I work remotely and live 2 hours away, so I've never met these people. I said ""yes"" and actually met a lot of employees in the company. There I found out the company would give $500-$1000 bonuses to those who get a certificate (some software shit).   Say yes more.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2483351/how-do-you-travel-as-an-autist#p2484551,How_do_you_travel_as_an_autist

Few bars later I talked to them again and we had fun. I left the crawl bit early because we went to a club with too loud ass music and my ears started to hurt.

"Jun-17-2023, 09:00:02","It's because you need to gain experience so you have something to relate to while talking with someone.   Next crawl you have, ask the chads questions about their life. People love talking about themselves. If you don't know what to ask, just follow up with ""why"" and keep getting them to talk about themselves.  If they feel uncomfortable about how inquisitive you are, congratulations, you are one step closer to not giving a fuck. It's called rejection therapy. It's not just with women, you can do this trying to make friends with men too.   You keep doing things that you know you will get rejected for, until it stops bothering you. A chad who feels weird about you asking so many questions will either fuck off or keep you around (if he is a narcissist).   If he fucks off, then look around to see if a Chad is being ""goofy"", such as dancing funny or drunkenly singing. If you know the song, start singing along with him. Make sure he sees you, and if you are the only one that sees him, he will probably go talk to you. Then you can just start asking him about his life. Whenever he asks about you, just answer but shift the focus back to him.   If Chad loses interest, tell yourself congratulations, it's another step in not giving a fuck.   You can do this with women eventually, just practice with men first. All you have to do is get people to talk about themselves. A nice person will invite you somewhere. Say yes. Things will fall into place, and something crazy might happen. If not, keep trying.   Then you will have something to talk about in your next conversation.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2483351/how-do-you-travel-as-an-autist#p2484573,How_do_you_travel_as_an_autist

That's fine, just have to accept that you're more of a quiet type. You don't have to take part in every single conversation.  I guess my problem is that I'm not afraid to talk to people, I simply can't think of anything to say. You need to find points in common with other people to work with in conversations, ask them about themselves or share stories of yours that might be funny, relevant and interesting to hear. The more things you experience in life, the more you have to talk about and the easier it gets.  Think of social skills like muscles that you have to train, the Chads just happened to be in environments where they could hone them early in life.

"Jun-17-2023, 09:44:59","I was there 12 years ago as a 20yo. I was vastly inexperienced so that alone should tell you it's easy to travel there.  Sights Luang Prabang -- a very beautiful and chill city/town Vang Vieng -- caves and tubing.. not sure about tubing anymore. It was a tourist shithole when I was there. Aussies getting drunk, parties 24/7. I think they banned a lot of it. Explore some caves with the locals who skip school kek Vientiane -- mostly boring, but the fortified banks of the Mekong are quite a sight Pakse -- chill city by the Mekong Si Phan Don -- don't skip this. It might be worth staying on some island that isn't a party island. I stayed on the biggest island, rented a bicycle and cycled through all the villages there.  Attitudes towards drugs? Don't. SEA is very strict on drugs.  Women like? Very different from Thailand in my experience. They're shy and reserved.  Bar and nightlife culture? Vang Vieng.. but not sure anymore. Otherwise Vientiane is your best bet.  Food? Very similar to Thai food. Rice/noodles with meat mostly. Try the bugs.  Worth spending a whole month there or just a few days? 2-3 weeks is more than enough for Laos imo. I entered at Huay Xai and took a speedboat to Luang Prabang, then buses down all the way to Cambodia. I never stayed anywhere longer than 2 days and it still took me 2 weeks to get through the country.

Very lovely scenery with dramatic misty hills and jungle. There are a few temples, but really the attraction is Laos being a mysterious rugged and authentic place in SEA that hardly is mentioned.  Attitudes towards drugs Weirdly they have shit like ""happy omelette"" which is laced with dope. It's a trap for hippie begpackers who get immediately arrested and extorted for bribes lest they be thrown in jail and forgotten about.

"Jun-22-2023, 09:06:39","Laos is my favourite country in all of SEA. Most people come to Laos as part of a longer SEA trip- the standard route is slow boat from chiang rai to LP to van vieng to vientiane to pakse to thakhek to Don det onwards to Cambodia. Most people miss out on the North (luang namtha, nong khiaw) but it’s a gorgeous region too. LP is touristic but a good way to begin your Laos journey. Vang vieng is just a bunch of drunk Ozzie’s and brits taking drugs and floating down the river. Vientiane is very boring. Pakse has the bolaven loop which is cool. Thakhek has the thakhek loop which is gorgeous. Don det is a sleepy island and a good way to end off the trip. Still, I think that painting Laos as this undiscovered, off the beaten track country is a bit disingenuous. The major route that I am describing is absolutely filled with backpackers, although most of the drunks just stay to LP and VV. Overall, it’s a beautiful country, and you can easily enjoy a month there as long as you get a bike and explore",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2484336/is-laos-worth-visiting-im-thinking-of-taking-trip#p2488613,No Subject

"Jun-22-2023, 09:21:16","My dream is to combine all religious pilgrimages into one 'mystical' journey, but I need to figure that out.   I know there is the Via Francigena from Cantebury, England to Rome. From there, I'd larp as a crusader to Jerusalem, stopping in Delphi, Mt. Athos, and Istanbul. Traditionally it goes through Syria, but if by then if it still isn't safe perhaps Cyprus & Lebanon. Then I'd larp as a Muslim on hajj from Jerusalem to Mecca.  From Mecca, is where it gets tricky.  There are several pilgrimages, but I'd prefer to keep heading East than go in circles. Mt. Kailash is sacred to 4 religions and has a trek, but it's in Tibet. There's the Char Dham for Hindus, in the Himalayas. There are Buddhist pilgrim sites further East up and within Nepal There is Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka where there's a sacred footprint which could be Shiva's, Buddha's, Adam's or St. Thomas' (they haven't decided yet I guess)  I guess I could follow the hippie trail and visit Goa on the way to Sri Lanka, go back up to Nepal? And from there the Hippie/Banana Pancake trail through Southeast Asia visiting various temples. I'd like to go through central China to visit the monasteries on top the jagged rocks, and head to Nagasaki, Japan (was place of Christian martyrs who got crucified, Catholic holdout in Japan before getting nuked by the Freemasons). Then I'd like to that Shikoku pilgrimage through various Shinto shrines as well as to Mt. Fuji and I suppose end it in Tokyo & later try an ayahuasca retreat in Peru.

I'm not against going to bang chicks, but you'll probably want to kill yourself after a week in Pattaya surrounded by the world's worst tourists and with little of interest in the daytime unless you enjoy tourist traps.  If you must... I would land, go to Pattaya for a few nights, then go somewhere else in the South or the North (there are still chicks to bang there) and actually have a worthwhile travel experience, then come back to Bangkok for a few nights before you fly home.  If you really love Pattaya and are having a miserable time elsewhere, then you can cut short the middle part and go back before heading back to Bangkok. Knowing that at least you tried to actually enjoy Thailand rather than just hanging out at god awful bars and clubs with screeching whores, angry russians and pathetic arabs and aussies.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2486883/thailand-general#p2487680,Thailand_General

"Jun-22-2023, 07:51:57","(REPLY) what drugs Anything that isn't weed. Generally speaking Africans are trying to sell ""cocaine"", which may or may not be actual coke that has been cut with horrible shit + fentanyl. They also sell bars and opoids (more Chinese fent), and on occasion may have ""heroin"" (fentanyl).  They also have meth. Lots of meth which is actually triads main import into Thailand. Tourists don't generally speaking want meth, but they do have it. Probably the safest thing to buy actually since it's for thais and thais will actually go to war with triads if they start killing them with meth cut with fent.  I don't recommend any of it, just giving a rundown as I understand it from having investigated this year.  The only time you should do drugs in Thailand is on a rooftop private party with crazy rich hiso folks who have pure supplies. The street level garbage has been cut multiple times first by triads then by distributors and finally street level dealers.

I lived opposite the Hell's Angels clubhouse on E 3rd St. The day I moved in I forgot you can't drink on the street, and was walking back home from the Wholefoods beer store drinking a Rogue Dead Guy when a Hell's Angel sitting on the bench outside the clubhouse said ""hey man, you think you're some kind of badass? you can't drink that on the street"", I said something British like ""oh shit!

They seem unaware that the Hell's Angels clubhouse is nearby. It's summer so everyone has their windows open, so I loudly shout 'get the fuck off my street'. Like magic (and as expected) a number of heads pop out of windows of the clubhouse, and a barrage of insults are exchanged. Foolishly, these chaps stand their ground and I'm asked if I need any help, before I have even answered there are Angels bursting out their front door and within seconds punches and kicks are being landed.

"Apr-17-2022, 14:31:46","Logically, a sex slave has no need for clothes. Her job is in the bedroom, or at least indoors, and she must remain available to her master at all times to serve his needs and whims. If he decides to take her out into public as eye candy, she still has no need for clothing because the entire point is to show her off. She has no need to be outside in the sun, rain, or snow because the exact distance she's going to be from her master at any given time is the length of her leash.  Thus, unless you want her to play dress up with cute clothes or appeal to a certain fetish, such as frilly dresses, thighhigh stockings, etc. she has no need for clothing. A slave's uniform denotes her purpose: the maid wears a dress and apron to make her role clear to observers and to keep her from getting dirty, a gardener wears overalls and a sunhat, and a sex slave's uniform is nothing at all.",http://boards.4chan.org/e/thread/2669577/slaves#p2678683,Slaves

In winter, put mink coat above that and change ballet flats to knee-high boots.  Although for outdoors, I'd have a large array of outfits for my slave girl (like skins for vidya characters or tuning for car: I'd like my property to be looking differently depending on my mood). Office lady attire is just the default one because I find ot sexy and tasteful at the same time. Think about Saber's civilian outfit in FSN UBW ecranisation from ufotable, except the tights are transparent of bodily color.  In private? Either completely nude or only in short (thigh length) silk robe/bridesmaid robe with or without lingerie underneath, and barefoot. Or only in a towel and barefoot. I have a mild foot fetish so my slave should always be barefoot at home. Whether she should also be completely nude or can wear short silk robe or lingerie - depends on my mood.  I'd also give her some light jewelry to wear both in public and in private, like earrings, rings, wrist braceletes and ankletes. After all, if we are in a slave owning society where it is legal and normal (I don't believe it'd be possible to keep her in modern society without getting arrested), a well dressed and bejeweled slave adds to social status of the owner.

The world runs on slavery and exploitation, be it slavery, child soldiering, or exploited workers in Africa, to slaves & trafficked workers in Arab nations, to suicidal Chinese ""workers"" in Asia (yay for concentration camps!). And guess what! None of you moralfags are ending slavery, despite it existing IN YOUR FACE both here and abroad. You will gladly lap up slave and sweat shop labor products day and night. Even stand outside for hours for them.   Think debt slavery isn't a thing here? Just look at child support and the so called ""deadbeat"" dad. You fucks will defend this shit too, despite it being literal debt slavery (supposedly the thing you are ""against""), but won't let it happen to precious women of course, as if that makes it any better. Criminal slaves are dead obvious: what do you think chain gangs and the people cleaning up streets are from? The only thing we got rid of was chattel/plantation slavery. We kept the rest.

"Mar-30-2023, 23:24:35","Just starting Saint Dorei Gakuen 2. The game starts with a slave auction for 3 girls in a high class underground nightclub. A 24 year old police woman, a surgeon of unspecified age and a highschool girl. They show their devotion to their overweight, scummy trainers, then go up for sale. After they're sold the MC meets with the manager of the club and auction. He has an assignment for him to break and enslave a family of girls for the next auction. The list of targets is the director of an elite school, her arrogant eldest daughter who's the principal of the school, her middle daughter who's the refined and sweet student council president and her two twin youngest daughters that are first year students.  The MC's own sex slave enrolls in the school to help him find out how to blackmail and or otherwise coerce the girls into compliance for their sex training and eventual enslavement and sale.  I can't post the image here because of the circumstances but I know from the official website that there's other images I can post later but the girls are gorgeous. Furthermore the MC starts expanding his net to capture more than just the family of girls that are his targets, not just because it will make his enslavement of the director and her daughters easier but more slaves are a good thing.  I'm liking this game so far. So many upper class elite girls to capture.

"Jun-11-2023, 14:43:40","a) It's better if you use Blender for weighing, but exporting a model to Blender and back can fuck stuff up. If you want your deformation to not fuck shit up depending on the rotation of the torso, you will need to take the weight value of your bone from the existing weight value of its parent bone (should be 下半身 in most cases) for each vertex plus make the weights smooth. You'll probably want to avoid weighing it any other way because of pic related (pregnant morph, belly weighed to all torso bones (torso 2 is negligible though) with very smooth BDEF4 weights + an invisible belly physics bone with values of up to 15%, normalized regularly [which is NOT what you should do], parented to an invisible movement bone, which is, in turn, parented to upper body and has a visible control bone, parented to lower body, as its local parent).  b) PMXView - Object Management (F2) - select ""Tension movement"" from the bottom dropdown. The objects closest to the center of the handle will be affected more. Boxes move the handle itself, which can also be used after you switch back to another handle type until you reset the selection (by undoing the last action or selectng an additional vertex, for example). This is useful for scaling and rotating. Smoothing might be a problem tho.  Keep in mind you won't get proper normals (for entirely correct shading) unless you create a separate material with your new belly shape and redo the normals for it (or save a new model with this shape and new normals), but it doesn't matter much if you aren't aiming for belly folds.",http://boards.4chan.org/e/thread/2784621/mmd-mikumikudance-184#p2785312,_mmd__MikuMikuDance__184

"Jun-15-2023, 04:12:54","The vertices you select limit the selection that could get influenced by the plugin, but the actual affected area is defined by the coordinates of the center and range. You could select the whole body, but it wouldn't all morph into a giant pregnant belly; you could select only the breasts, but the [default] range set in the parameters doesn't reach them from the central point, so nothing will happen; you can also select just a few vertices near the center point and get a skinny spike protruding from the stomach (just remember to reset the target selection in the dialog if you change it while the plugin is running), similarly to setting a small range. The size of the selection does not appear to affect computing time. As for the overhang and dangle parameters, which define the basic shape, they're up to the user's tastes. I do not recommend expansion along the Y axis, and expanding along X should be very conservative, within 0.2 at most, if you aren't into grotesque shit. Repeated execution with the same parameters does not stack (reposition the vertices further), unless you refresh/re-retrieve the PMX data stored by the plugin.  In other news, after I launched the plugin again to check it for you, I suddenly realized the dialog had those missing tabs. I had forgotten to put 1.0.1 back, yet I was able to launch the plugin with 1.2.0 and 2.0.0 in the plugin folder, unlike before, despite no changes in the environment that could theoretically influence it.

Here's some screenshots about what the models look like https://sta.sh/21a6ycmdfgxb I'm mainly interested in: -Bloom (casual outfit, charmix fairy form, enchantix fairy form and tynix fairy form) -Stella (casual outfit, charmix fairy form and enchantix fairy form) -Flora (casual outfit, charmix fairy form and enchantix fairy form) -Tecna (enchantix fairy form) -Musa (casual outfit and enchantix fairy form) -Aisha (casual outfit and enchantix fairy form) -Valtor -The Trix (Icy, Stormy and Darcy)  Link of game: https://www.roblox.com/games/10633476312/The-Fairy-Guardians-LIMITED-PARTY-EVENT I promise you I won't bother here anymore after thid, but please just this time, I'm begging all of you...

If it does, you don't have to ask for catbox, it's already there.   How do I fix bad hands? Try the sd-webui-depth-lib (needs sd-webui-controlnet) and the inpainting guide in the OP Also try the Krita plugin (auto-sd-paint-ext) for an improved inpainting/img2img workflow There are also embeddings in the negative prompt that attempt to address this.

"Jun-21-2023, 15:29:44","Before I moved out of the small town that I was staying at in my 20s I set up a glory hole in a park bathroom, wrote on the stall walls and then came back in a few days.  I sat in there for about 30 minutes until someone got into the stall next to me. Turns out he was definitely there for the glory hole and a 7 inch but kind of skinny cock was pushed through the hole. I sucked a big load out of that cut cock.   Once he left immediately someone else came in, I think ""oh I'm so lucky"" and when that cock gets poked through it was just an average cut cock but I got to work. When he was close to cumming he started moaning and I thought it sounded like he was like just old enough to go off to college.  He left and then immediately another guy. That's when I realized I was probably blowing some group of friends.   The next guy was uncut and kind of small. Not a micro dick but I couldn't get much in my mouth through the stall wall. So I whisper to him telling him to get on his knees and feed it to me under the stall. His balls were completely smooth and he didn't have a very big bush but guys develop late sometimes. As I blew him I used the acccess to slide my hand past his balls and rub his asshole. When he shot it was only 1 or 2 shots but they fired hard down the back of my throat.  Ended up suck another 2 dicks from that group. When I walked out there were some guys sitting by the skate park smirking at me.

To keep a long story short, they had quite a big house and had a cottage/annexe in the garden that nobody used. I used to go sit in the loft area of it because the house got too warm for me at night. The bed was below, but I'd sit up in the roof just reading. One night at about 2am my classmate and her dad came in and I didn't want them to know I was there so I just shuffled back out of sight. They started hugging and I thought something must have happened and he was comforting her. Then he put his hand up her skirt and I just went cold.

I was more sad about loosing that OC than the $2300 that baboon stole using cashapp.  Phones are fucking dangerous legally. Did you know your phone represents your Identity? Any guarantee against theft is superceded if the assailant uses your phone to do it, because the phone CONFIRMS YOUR IDENTITY.  Meaning any crime committed with your phone, regardless of guarantee or promised security feature LEGALLY CANNOT be enforced WITHOUT a police report.  And this is how they increase technology, yet take away effectiveness....right before your eyes.

"Jun-21-2023, 18:08:00","9 they will be ABUNDANT. Debatable. There may be a lot of guns around now, but ask yourself how many of them are ready to be fired after 5 years of [modern society] melting away. Assume the United States of America was nuked, for example. We won't all glow, but the reality is that many of those guns are not going to be useful or accessible. Or, in useful hands. Possibly dangerous hands. EMT will be overworked, the other branches of government will be scrambled... Debris, fires, imagine all of this. What's the first thing anyone does, in that chaos? Think. Pew, pew. This is mine, get away. By the time a few years have passed, the odds of anyone knowing to maintain a gun has gone down significantly- because the population has, as well. Ammunition has been spent, and guns have probably not been cleaned. You are not ordering more. Rich doods are likely hording their guns from the lower tiers of survivors, and so the private security forces aren't necessarily operating outside the confines of wherever they have been ""employed"". It's possible that this doesn't materialize and the rich doods get iced, but that just means a mercenary is living with his extended family of GUNNERS in a nice place, that's all. You can't fuel and maintain so many guns forever, anyways. How are you getting around the Wasteland? Yer not. Not without being more coordinated than a local militia or some yahoos who found a fueled-up helicopter that they will probably crash seconds after taking off. Who here, knows how to fly a helicopter? You don't want to wing it. You will die. What I'm saying, is that despite the number of guns here... the actual amount of guns that will threaten you, will get exponentially lower over time. But, that does not diminish their danger. Save for a pistol at long range, any yahoo could potentially getcha. They may not be aiming there, but they could get you in that leg.
