"Jun-21-2023, 13:49:16",is learning simplified mandarin essential? i've been learning traditional because i didn't want to be a retard who only knows a dumbed down version of a language. but now i'm realising you probably can't even read simplified if you only know traditional.  pretty stupid.,http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2481880/qtddtot#p2487967,QTDDTOT
"Jun-21-2023, 14:00:24","going from traditional characters to simplified characters isn't too hard. if you can read chinese already you can just pick up a book you read in 繁體字 and force yourself through the 简体字 edition. after 2-3 books, you'll be reading both versions and all that's left is picking up mainland slang.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2481880/qtddtot#p2487975,QTDDTOT
"Jun-21-2023, 14:26:57","the point isn't how hard the transition will be, it's a waste of time for me to learn both.  i was just wondering if all of the information signs, screens in shops and stations will be all simplified. i better not learn what won't be useful to me in the mainland.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2481880/qtddtot#p2487993,QTDDTOT
"Jun-21-2023, 14:38:25","it's fairly easy, in taiwan you have to rely on your traditional characters, simplified will be sparse and limited to places where mainlanders are expected to hang out, i.e. tourist traps and drugstores near tourist traps and transportation hubs. same applies in the prc where traditional characters won't be seen much outside of decorations and historical context.  the good news is that going from traditional to simplified is easier than the other way round, so you won't waste much time going 繁體字 - 简体字. the opposite direction is possible as well, but you will struggle a little more. learning the other set of characters after being comfortable with one of them isn't that much of a deal, trust me.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2481880/qtddtot#p2487999,QTDDTOT

"Jun-22-2023, 01:11:51","so i've got roughly a one-month window between december and january. this isn't a destination question, but more of a timing question.  consider the following: roughly one month (30 days, give or take) trip starts in december, ends in january christmas and new year's are unavoidable; just a matter of when they will happen moving the trip to a different month is not an option  which would you prefer? a) start the trip in late december, celebrating christmas & new year's at the beginning, rest of the trip is normal b) start the trip in early december; christmas is celebrated near the end of the trip, and go home a couple of days after the new year",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2481880/qtddtot#p2488353,QTDDTOT

"Jun-22-2023, 01:25:23","this makes sense, but the suggestion still isn't useful to me. 繁體字 - 简体字 is not just ignoring extra parts of characters, there are completely different characters to learn, and would make no sense learning two different ways of reading and writing just to visit a country.  thank you anyway as this is still good information to know.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2481880/qtddtot#p2488363,QTDDTOT

"Jun-22-2023, 03:42:20","only been to malta, definitely worth it. valletta is cool and there's some solid castles and churches all over the island. gozo is nice for a one or two day trip. the lagoon is ok, but horribly crowded. megalithic sites are great if you know what to expect (big fucking stones) and are in it just for the age. they're in the middle of nowhere, but that's fine if you have a car. speaking of cars, malta's traffic is obnoxious for a tiny island. narrow streets that get clogged up in massive traffic jams. the bus network is the most dysfunctional piece of shit i've ever seen, but you'd be mercifully skipping on that with a rental. driving on the left is awkward at the start, gets easier later but never really becomes truly intuitive. you're not likely to fuck up and crash into someone though. as the other guy said, your biggest issue will be turning on the wipers all the time. kinnie's delicious. it's malta's own soda of bitter oranges and herbs that's very rarely exported but is absolutely everywhere in the country itself, probably having coca-cola beat. don't miss it. maltese cuisine is frankly a bit shit and limited outside of one rabbit dish, but there's plenty of sicilian-run restaurants that are excellent.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2481880/qtddtot#p2488406,QTDDTOT
