"Jun-15-2023, 13:58:37","i had to spend one day in lisbon before flying to the us. i autistically walked around. i didn't really talk to anybody except waiters. i visited a bunch of churches and that's it. everyone around me appeared to be enjoying themselves, indulging in midday drinks with friends. the city seemed packed with anglos and digital nomads. i was uncomfortable in crowded landmarks and would leave immediately if a place was too full. this tends to be the pattern for all of my travels. i've been to some cities and i don't have any stories to tell because i don't interact with people at all. i know a guy who has crazy stories from each travel just because he fucking talks to people and do drugs in clubs or plays sports with random people from facebook groups. i feel like checking the local sights and eating local food is not enough. at times, it feels pointless for me to travel. is it even feasible for someone like me, a sperg, to travel? do i need to change my approach, or should i stop traveling altogether?",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2483351/how-do-you-travel-as-an-autist#p2483351,How_do_you_travel_as_an_autist

"Jun-16-2023, 09:05:47","i had a thread here 3 years ago, i went to lisbon aswell and i lost my virginity there. i was like you in the city, and i met the goddes by asking her which train should i hop on to get to a museum. she told me i am dumb because its monday and all the museums are closed, but she is heading to the beach and i can go with her if i want.  what i want to say are two things: a - for guys like us we need to get out of the comfort zone and try. just before i asked her on the street i got nervos, and i almost decided to fuck it and get back to the hotel. but i gathered courage, i was sweating and still did it. b: you said that you visited only churches? why? you need to go towards the adventure. when i was in kathmandu i found a cheap bus for the locals which headed to the chitwan national park so i said fuck it lets go. on the bus every nepali was asking me where am i going, we had a great talk. we got into a traffic jam next to a village, i had no more water so i went to buy from the ordinary guys, they invited me to their huts and gave me like a 100 year old coca cola. the traffic jam got seriously big and i was in the village for 6 hours. the night came and the whole village wanted to check out the white guy, everybody wanted to have a talk with me. then the police came, the jam was caused by a truck which has fallen into a mud, and they need people to pull it out because they are tired. i volunteered and i helped to pull out a truck in a middle of a nowhere at night. in nepal. me, a fucking antisocial loser. when we did it everybody was celebrating, the team of pullers opened a bottle of rum and they didnt let me go until i had a drink with them.  tldr my advice is to try to get out of your comfort zone (believe me i know its hard, and it will be hard for me all over my life), and don't ve afraid to try the unknown. just dont do any dangerous shit, and dont do drugs.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2483351/how-do-you-travel-as-an-autist#p2483885,How_do_you_travel_as_an_autist

"Jun-17-2023, 08:21:22","i am also an autistic introvert who was the same as you.  the way i got over this was after reading a book called yes man by danny wallace (there is a famous movie, but the book is better).   (no spoilers i promise): basically, it's a memoir of an english guy who had a lonely and isolated life until a stranger on a bus told him to ""say yes more"". he autistically twisted that to start saying yes to everything, and his life completely changed.   anyway, by forcing yourself to say yes to everything, you are basically surrendering to god's will, putting your life in the hands of the universe. it's easy for people to just say ""just put yourself out there, do drugs, etc."" but what you need is to practice radical openness. you need to force yourself to say yes, even if it makes you uncomfortable. obviously, set boundaries on illegal shit, but just say yes to everything. start at home first, then you will eventually end up traveling.  this is me, the stranger on the bus, telling you and anyone reading this to ""say yes more"". just say yes. you see something on a bulletin board? just go to it. homeless guy asks for $5? give it to him, or buy him something worth $5. a peace corps recruiter is speaking at your university? go to it - that's how my friend ended up living in kyrgyzstan for 2 years.  something that happened to me: i usually get emails from my company saying there is a get-together at some restaurant. i work remotely and live 2 hours away, so i've never met these people. i said ""yes"" and actually met a lot of employees in the company. there i found out the company would give $500-$1000 bonuses to those who get a certificate (some software shit).   say yes more.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2483351/how-do-you-travel-as-an-autist#p2484551,How_do_you_travel_as_an_autist
"Jun-17-2023, 08:37:57","the crawl started a bit akward as i was in a same group with a bunch of loud german chads, so i felt left out as usual. they noticed i was lonely and tried to talk to me but quickly lost interest in me. later some american also arrived and easily started chatting with them. few bars later i talked to them again and we had fun. i left the crawl bit early because we went to a club with too loud ass music and my ears started to hurt. i guess my problem is that i'm not afraid to talk to people, i simply can't think of anything to say.  that's my story, thanks for reading.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2483351/how-do-you-travel-as-an-autist#p2484564,How_do_you_travel_as_an_autist
"Jun-17-2023, 09:00:02","it's because you need to gain experience so you have something to relate to while talking with someone.   next crawl you have, ask the chads questions about their life. people love talking about themselves. if you don't know what to ask, just follow up with ""why"" and keep getting them to talk about themselves.  if they feel uncomfortable about how inquisitive you are, congratulations, you are one step closer to not giving a fuck. it's called rejection therapy. it's not just with women, you can do this trying to make friends with men too.   you keep doing things that you know you will get rejected for, until it stops bothering you. a chad who feels weird about you asking so many questions will either fuck off or keep you around (if he is a narcissist).   if he fucks off, then look around to see if a chad is being ""goofy"", such as dancing funny or drunkenly singing. if you know the song, start singing along with him. make sure he sees you, and if you are the only one that sees him, he will probably go talk to you. then you can just start asking him about his life. whenever he asks about you, just answer but shift the focus back to him.   if chad loses interest, tell yourself congratulations, it's another step in not giving a fuck.   you can do this with women eventually, just practice with men first. all you have to do is get people to talk about themselves. a nice person will invite you somewhere. say yes. things will fall into place, and something crazy might happen. if not, keep trying.   then you will have something to talk about in your next conversation.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2483351/how-do-you-travel-as-an-autist#p2484573,How_do_you_travel_as_an_autist
"Jun-17-2023, 09:04:53","the crawl started a bit akward as i was in a same group with a bunch of loud german chads, so i felt left out as usual. i think that sometimes it's more awkward in your head than in reality. in groups, there's always going to be people who are louder and more talkative and then some quieter folks. that's fine, just have to accept that you're more of a quiet type. you don't have to take part in every single conversation.  i guess my problem is that i'm not afraid to talk to people, i simply can't think of anything to say. you need to find points in common with other people to work with in conversations, ask them about themselves or share stories of yours that might be funny, relevant and interesting to hear. the more things you experience in life, the more you have to talk about and the easier it gets.  think of social skills like muscles that you have to train, the chads just happened to be in environments where they could hone them early in life. most people can reach that point with enough practice.",http://boards.4chan.org/trv/thread/2483351/how-do-you-travel-as-an-autist#p2484576,How_do_you_travel_as_an_autist
